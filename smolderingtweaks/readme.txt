-- Introduction --
------------------

Just a series of tweaks made by yours truly for my personal game!

------------------
-- Installation --
------------------

Ensure that your game is updated to the latest version and unpack the archive into the main Baldur's Gate/II: Enhanced Edition folder, then run setup-Smoldering-Tweaks and follow the installation instructions. Below is a breakdown of what each component offers.

If you are playing Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition using Steam or GOG and have Siege of Dragonspear installed, make sure you download and install DLC Merger (by Argent77) or modmerge (by Scott Brooks) before downloading this and any other mods.

PALADIN AURAS:

This component adds unique once-per day innate abilities for the Paladin, Cavalier, Inquisitor, and Undead Hunter classes.
The abilities are modeled off the Blackguard's 'Aura of Despair' created by Beamdog, and are powerful, scaling castable abilities.

- Paladin: Aura of Courage
- Cavalier: Aura of Valor
- Inquisitor: Aura of Warding
- Undead Hunter: Aura of Fortitude

GIVE BRANWEN'S SPRITUAL HAMMER ITS ORIGINAL VISUAL AND AUDIO EFFECT

Somewhere along the line, Beamdog changed the audiovisual effects of Spiritual Hammer across the board, but I missed Branwen's instant "CLANG" when summoning her hammer. Now it's back.
